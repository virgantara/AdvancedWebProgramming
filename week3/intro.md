## Intro to NodeJS

Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. Traditionally, JavaScript was used only on the client side (i.e., in the browser), but with the introduction of Node.js, developers can now use JavaScript for server-side programming, building scalable and high-performance applications.

## Key Concepts of Node.js:

- Non-blocking, Asynchronous I/O:
        Non-blocking I/O allows Node.js to handle multiple operations simultaneously. This is a major difference from traditional server-side platforms like PHP or Java, which are typically synchronous and blocking.
        When an operation (such as reading a file or making an API request) is performed, Node.js does not wait for the operation to complete. Instead, it continues executing the next line of code, improving efficiency and performance.
        This is particularly useful for handling multiple concurrent connections, such as in web servers, where Node.js can handle thousands of requests without waiting for one to complete before starting the next.

- Event-Driven Architecture:
        Node.js uses an event-driven model, where an event (like a request from a client or a completed database query) triggers a callback function to be executed. This means that Node.js applications are able to respond to numerous requests without being blocked.
        The event loop in Node.js continuously checks for events and processes them as soon as they are triggered, keeping the application responsive.

- Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable:
        Although Node.js operates in a single-threaded environment, it can handle many requests concurrently due to its asynchronous nature. Unlike traditional multi-threaded architectures, where each request is handled by a separate thread, Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple requests.
        This makes Node.js very efficient and lightweight, especially for applications with high I/O (input/output) operations, such as reading files, making database queries, or handling HTTP requests.

- Built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine:
        Node.js is built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript to native machine code before execution. This makes Node.js extremely fast when compared to other server-side technologies.

- Package Ecosystem (npm):
        Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries and packages. With npm, developers can easily install, share, and manage third-party libraries to extend the functionality of their Node.js applications.
        npm has over 1.5 million packages, ranging from database connectors, authentication libraries, frameworks (like Express.js), to tools for testing, debugging, and deployment
