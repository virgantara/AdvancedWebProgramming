# Build basic APIs, handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with Express.
In this course, you will focus on using Express to build and test a RESTful API with the fundamental HTTP methods.

## Introduction to HTTP Methods and RESTful APIs

Topics:

    Overview of RESTful API: Quick recap of REST principles and how it aligns with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
